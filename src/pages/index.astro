      Hello 🙋‍♂️ my name is <strong>Ausath</strong>, or <strike>wrath</strike>
      <i>(ign)</i>. I'm an undergraduate student currently majoring in
      Information Systems. I'm interested in
      <strong>front-end web development</strong> and are currently learning to build
      websites with <strong>Astro</strong> 🤓, in fact, I used it to build this website
      (still in progress). I enjoy listening to music and playing games on my free
      time, feel free to add me on Spotify and Discord 🎮.
