    <p>
      Hello 🙋‍♂️ my name is <strong>Ausath</strong>, or <strike>wrath</strike> <i>(ign)</i>. 
      I'm an undergraduate student currently majoring in Information Systems. I'm interested 
      in <strong>front-end web development</strong> and are currently learning to build 
      websites with <strong>Astro</strong> 🤓, in fact, I used it to build this website 
      (still in progress) as part of my learning process. As of doing things on my free time, 
      I enjoy listening to music and playing games so feel free to add me on Spotify and Discord 🎮.

      Right now, I'm a part of the front-end developer team for an internal project 
      at <strong>KSM Android UPNVJ</strong>. We're currently building a Study Club 
      LMS for our members.
