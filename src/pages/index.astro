      Hello 🙋‍♂️ my name is <strong>Ausath</strong>, or <strike>wrath</strike>
      <i>(ign)</i>. I'm an undergraduate student currently majoring in
      Information Systems. I'm interested in <strong
        >front-end web development</strong
      >
      and are currently learning to build websites with <strong>Astro</strong>
      🤓, in fact, I used it to build this website (still in progress) as part of
      my learning process. As of doing things on my free time, I enjoy listening
      to music and playing games so feel free to add me on Spotify and Discord 🎮.
