      Hello 🙋‍♂️ my name is <strong>Ausath</strong>, or <strike>wrath</strike>
      <i>(ign)</i>. I'm an undergraduate student currently majoring in
      Information Systems. I'm interested in <strong
        >front-end web development</strong
      >
      and are currently learning to build websites with <strong>Astro</strong>
      🤓, in fact, I used it to build this website (still in progress) as part of
      my learning process. As of doing things on my free time, I enjoy listening
      to music and playing games so feel free to add me on Spotify and Discord 🎮.

      Right now, I'm a part of the front-end developer team for an internal
      project at <strong>KSM Android UPNVJ</strong>. We're currently building a
      Study Club LMS for our members.

      Aside from web development stuff, I learned programming with <strong
        >C</strong
      > in university. Doing stuff with C makes you learn <i
        >how things actually works</i
      > cause there's a lot less
      <strong>abstraction</strong> unlike modern programming languages. It really
      helps to understand something to its very basics, especially data structures.
      For example in C, there are no built-in functions for a lot of data structures
      like stack and queue. Learning how to make them from scratch helps me understand
      how they work better.
